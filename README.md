# Glioblastoma Stem Cell circRNA Analysis

CircRNA analysis performed wıth [miARma-seq](https://github.com/eandresleon/miARma-seq) on NCBI SRA sample [SRR16352157](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR16352157).

The reference genome (UCSC hg19) can be found on the [HISAT2 download page](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/download/).

The [BWA Index used for alignment](https://sourceforge.net/projects/miarma/files/Genomes/Index_bwa_hg19.tar.bz2/download) of the sample is the same one used in miARma-seq's official guide for circRNA analysis. 

The GTF file used for calculating the count of circRNA reads was included with miARma-seq (`Examples/basic_examples/circRNAs/data/Homo_sapiens_GRCh37.74_chr.gtf`).
